# Really important notes:
* Don't mention words like 'pseudo code' etc. These are just notes for you, as a *teacher*, so please break down what you're saying into simple English.
* Try to make the lessons fit as neatly as you can. So that means trying to cover all the content, avoid overrunning, and avoid cutting the lesson short by speeding through the content!
* Take regular breaks, and ask kids if they have any questions or don't understand things. 
	* If kids don't understand things, try and explain it differently, rather than repeating what you've just said. Use analogies! Analogies are good!
* If you don't finish everything, it's fine! Just make a note of where you got to and start there next week.
* Always start off by recapping what you did last lesson (only spend about 5 minutes on this!)
* I've included some examples of things to do, but please get creative in explanations. 
	* There should be lots of activities that you can do, to help represent the ideas and logic, but don't stray too far. Keep the abstractions to a minimum. 
* Give the kids a lot of freedom, so when giving examples, get them to give loads of suggestions (and get them to answer their own questions etc.)
	* Especially when it comes to programming, get them to try out their own ideas too. 
* It should be quite fun for us too, but please don't go into your own jokes during the lesson since the kids will get confused, and you might distract whoever is trying to explain things at that moment. 
* Finally, remember that you're a teacher but you're nicer. So if people ask (seemingly) stupid questions, then answer them as if you really care about it. 
	* Computer Science and coding needs to seem cool, so inject some things about games and other applications of the stuff their learning into your lesson!

# Preparing for a lesson
## Extension tasks
* Hopefully, one of the organising group can write up two extension tasks per lesson, so that if kids do finish early, they have something more complex and interesting to dwell on.

## End of lesson tasks
* When we get on to programming and some more interesting features (not variable assignment etc.), a programming task should take up the last 5 to 10 minutes of the lesson. 
	* All of the kids should take part in this.
	* The task should focus on skills and techniques learned that lesson.
	* Help should be given freely at this stage, since we are really trying to fill in the gaps in their understanding.
	
## Lesson-long tasks
* Every 3 or 4 lessons, we should plan to have a whole lesson of programming freely. 
* A task should be created that uses the knowledge learnt over the course, and should be relevant, interesting and have a 'real-life scenario' feel about it.
	* Boring things like currency converters etc. are too dull, this is an exciting session! Make up a story to make the simple task more exciting!
	* Both classes will do the same task.
* Remember, this is **not** a competition!
	* Or a test! So give everyone as much help as they need. Hopefully this can check that everyone is up to speed.
	
## Comparing Students' Code
* For many problems in computing, there are multiple answers or methods of doing things.
	* Emphasise this! If you can get to the same point as everyone else, it's still a success!
	* But there are more elegant, efficient and clearer solutions. 
* Compare code that looks fast, and code that looks slower, but is more understandable. Remember to justify which is better for this scenario, and to make it clear that the clarity of solution is key.
* A good time to do this would be at the start of every lesson, after everyone has settled down. 

## Extending learning after sessions
* You can learn a lot from programming by yourself, so it may be a good idea to send kids away from a classroom with some ideas of what they can look up or do between lessons:
	* CodeAcademy is a great resource, especially when introducing Python. It means you won't have to sweat over the basics for too long (hopefully).
	* Telling kids to look up videos on YouTube about a certain topic may be useful. 
	* Advise kids to for solutions to their errors on the internet, since it's a great resource.
	* If appropriate, get kids to find out some extra information between a lesson, and discuss what they found at the beginning of the next. 
* Hopefully we can put challenges up on a blog, that will be available to the kids when they're at home, so if they fancy a challenge, they can go ahead and try them out. 

# During or after the lesson

## In the unlikely event that you'll finish early...
* Don't go onto the next lesson! The lessons are structured to work well in one run, so that the knowledge is consolidated. 
* Use what you've done for a different creative task.
* Maybe just ask the kids for ideas on what they want to make when we get to the project stage!
	* Talk about competitions, and what they want to do for them, and maybe what the prizes might be (don't promise anything).
	
## Lesson write up
* I think it would be great if a couple of the people from each class wrote a short write up of what they did after each lesson.
	* This could hopefully include the extra activities (that aren't mentioned in the lesson frame); what went well and what didn't; what was fun to teach and what wasn't; and what the kids enjoyed most (this is a good question to ask before they all leave)
* Hopefully I can have the write up by the next day or two, it shouldn't take more than ten minutes to write a fairly detailed piece. 

## Administration notes
* On the first lesson, get a list of the 25 or so kids' full names, to put onto a register. (Typing the names would be useful)
* Collect this week's lunch passes if they haven't been taken already.
	* Don't give out next week's lunch passes until the end of the lesson!
* The lesson says it starts at 1:30, but aim to start *teaching* at 1:35. Getting everyone sat down might take a few minutes. 
* Don't be super strict! We don't want kids to mess around, but a light chatter (hopefully work or computer science related) is healthy for the non-lecture-like environment that we're trying to create.
