# Lesson Title
##### ARRAYS, IF STATEMENTS, VARIABLES

Short summary of what this lesson will be about. What is the problem, and what does the solution need to do (this part is short).

## Task 1: Task title
<!-- Break into paragraphs -->
What do we have to do [context]? How will it help us get to a solution. 

<!-- Steps and reasons for doing it -->
#### Step List:
* Check for code, using `if code` on the first line. This will be needed later etc.
* Make it do things 
	* To make sure you don't get lost, use the `#`, and then write whatever you want after... comment.. etc...


#### Got lost? Here's the code.
```python
if code:
	lots of code
	# Comments are good!
```
<!-- Comment -->
Paragraph explanation of what the code does. Here is the computer science. 

## Task 2: Task title
<!-- Break into paragraphs -->
What do we have to do [context]?

#### Step List:
* Check for code, using `if code` on the first line. This will be needed later etc.
* Make it do things 


#### Got lost? Here's the code.
```python
if code:
	lots of code
	# Comments are good!
else: 
	# Do other stuff
	# Tabs are important
	# Talk about syntax and how it's important!
```
<!-- Explain the computer science -->
Paragraph explanation of what the code does. Here is the computer science. 


## And... we're done!
<!-- Summary of what we've achieved -->
We've used arrays and Boolean if statements to solve the ... (this should be a small paragraph, but fairly chunky)

```python
if code:
	lots of code
	# Comments are good!
elif: 
	# Do other stuff
	# Tabs are important
	# Talk about syntax and how it's important!
	# Comments are good!
else: 
	# Do other stuff
	# Tabs are important
	# Talk about syntax and how it's important!
```
<!-- Run through of the code line by line (only done for the last part of code -->
#### Line by line guide
1. Code is started
2. Code continue 
3. A comment in the code. This line is ignored by the computer


## Challenge Task
What's the problem changed to? What do we need to change? Only use skills tested in this section. You can have multiple stages if you think it's complicated, but there shouldn't be any code help!
